Welcome to the Text Summarization Application! This project focuses on creating an efficient and user-friendly application that automatically generates concise and coherent summaries of input text. Whether you're dealing with lengthy articles, research papers, or any other type of content, this application will help you extract the most important information with ease.



## Installation and Setup
I give the necessary information about the software requirement.

- Machine Learning: This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `torch, transformers`
- Deployment: Package used to create web app `streamlit`


## Future work

- Interactive Visualization: 
Develop interactive visualizations that highlight the most important parts of the text and display the summary generation process step by step, enhancing user understanding of the summarization process.
