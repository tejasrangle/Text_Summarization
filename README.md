## Installation and Setup
I give the necessary information about the software requirement.

- Machine Learning: This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as `torch, transformers`
- Deployment: Package used to create web app `streamlit`


## Future work

- Interactive Visualization: 
Develop interactive visualizations that highlight the most important parts of the text and display the summary generation process step by step, enhancing user understanding of the summarization process.
